# ðŸŽ§ AudioCast Streaming System

- A **Client** that receives audio streams and displays a GUI for controlling playback.




## Features

- Real-time audio streaming.
- Automatic folder monitoring for `.rfa` file creation.
- GUI-based client with tray icon support.
- Pause and resume broadcast functionality.
- Automatic reconnect with retry mechanism.
- Multi-threaded server supporting multiple clients.
